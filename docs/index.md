## What is HED Web?

HED Web Tools provides an intuitive **web-based interface** for working with Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) data. Whether you're a researcher annotating experimental data or a developer integrating HED processing into your workflow, our tools make HED operations accessible and efficient.

## Getting Started

The HED web tools are available online at [hedtools.org/hed](https://hedtools.org/hed) or can be deployed locally for your own use.

### Online Access
- **Production**: [https://hedtools.org/hed](https://hedtools.org/hed) - Stable version for general use
- **Development**: [https://hedtools.org/hed_dev](https://hedtools.org/hed_dev) - Latest features and experimental tools

### Local Installation
For local deployment, see the [User Guide](user_guide.md) for detailed installation instructions.

## Core Capabilities

**Data Validation**: Validate HED annotations in event files, sidecars, spreadsheets, and strings against HED schemas.

**Format Conversion**: Convert between different HED formats (long/short forms) and file types.

**Data Processing**: Search HED annotations, assemble complex annotations, and execute remodeling operations.

**Schema Management**: Work with different HED schema versions and compare schemas.
